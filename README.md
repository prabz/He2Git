##Script Made to scrape all my Hackerearth solutions (close to 1200 at the time of writing)

#Purpose

    I wanted to port all my solutions of [HACKEREARTH] (https://www.hackerearth.com/users/prashantpandeyfun10/)
    to Github. But as I have close to 1200 solutions (with multiple entries) I thought of writing a script to do that.

#How it is different?
    HackerEarth loads the content dynamically and when you scroll down for 5 times you see a "View More" button which
    when clicked loads more data. So the whole challenge was to automate scrolling and clicking on this "View More"
    button.
    
#Stack used
    I have used Selenium (python api) to do all the scrolling and clicking and have used Firefox driver of Selenium.
    For some reason Chrome was a pain in a** to work with. So YA! choosing and pondering upon the stack prior to jump
    on coding is one I learnt.
    Was suppose to use [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) and 
    
    [gitpython](http://gitpython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html)
    but I thought of leaving that for a while as of now.
    
# Help?

    for some people and awesome for some people!
